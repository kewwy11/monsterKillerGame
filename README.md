Made the monster killing game using Vue, Javascript, CSS and html.
I made use of the the @click, v-bind and v-model, also made used of methods to define each function to be carried out when the button was clicked.
At the click of the attack or special attack the monster's life is reduced and immediately the monster attacks back. 
The player life is increased dynamically when the heal button is clicked and the monster attacks immediately after that.
The game ends and the monster wins when the surrender button is clicked, the results are dropped with with a restart button.
A battlelog is used to show the various activities.
